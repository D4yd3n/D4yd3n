Hey! I'm Dryden, I was born in Canada and I'm 19 years old.
I've been learning the fundamentals of the majority of cs languages and been putting my knowledge to the test with little projects. 
I'm not an amazing programmer but I'm eager to learn. I wanna get into the creative part of programming and have been learning quick. 
I have some projects located in my public repository if you wanna take a look at my work. I'm pretty sure theres a Words Per Minute Calculator in there, as well as a password strength checker. 
I'm looking to have some mentors teach me or to join some people in creating something amazing.
